# tuya-python-examples
A repo to create and share more detailed examples of how to use the Tuya API with Python.
This is using the tuya-connector-python library found here:https://github.com/tuya/tuya-connector-python
It is not very active... so a bit suspect, but seems to work at the basic level

  Important note on this... They Smart Industry app is not longer supported. You need another way to provision devices into your account.
  We did this three ways 1) used a virtual device (not very satisfying), 2) registered devices in Smat Life app then linked the account 
  and 3) Created an app with the SDK, linked the app to the IoT project and paired devices from custom app.
- IoT Console - the debugging console can be useful
